“The Myth of Sisyphus” by Albert Camus is a philosophical essay that explores the nature of human existence and the search for meaning in a world that appears to be indifferent to our struggles. The essay takes its title from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a king who was condemned by the gods to roll a boulder up a hill for all eternity, only to see it roll back down again each time he reached the top.

Camus uses the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the human condition, arguing that our lives are similarly marked by a sense of futility and absurdity. We are all Sisyphus, condemned to repeat the same actions over and over again, without ever achieving any real sense of purpose or fulfillment.

But Camus also suggests that there is a kind of beauty in this struggle, a defiance and resilience that allows us to find meaning in the face of the absurd. He writes, “The struggle itself […] is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

For Camus, the search for meaning is not something that can be found in external sources, such as religion or philosophy, but is instead a deeply personal and subjective experience. He argues that we must confront the absurdity of existence head-on, accepting it for what it is and finding ways to create meaning in our own lives.

Camus’ prose is both elegant and accessible, and his ideas have had a profound impact on modern philosophy and literature. “The Myth of Sisyphus” is a powerful meditation on the human condition, challenging us to confront the fundamental questions of existence and to find our own way in a world that often seems indifferent to our struggles.
